This was entered for a hackathon at Stanislaus
Theme was build anything that uses Google Cloud 
So we created a program that uses Google Vision API to create an image detection program
It detects any texts in the image, it detects famous landmarks (such as Eiffel Tower), and the emotion of the person if there
are any in the photo

Also outputs which emotion is most likely seen if there are multiple photos with faces.
